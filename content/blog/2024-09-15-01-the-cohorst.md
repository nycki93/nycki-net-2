I don't think we're going to ever have a true "successor" to Cohost, and I don't think we should! I think we should look at this more like [The LucasArts Breakup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm_Games#Legacy) which resulted in Doublefine, Telltale, and a handful of smaller indie teams, each one led by an alumni of the previous team.

- **Mynotaurus** has already stepped up with [an active Mastodon](https://floofy.tech/@mynotaurus) and [The Enclave Webring](https://zatzhing.me/webring)
- **Smutteo** has put together [The NSFW Cohost Starter Pack](https://bsky.app/profile/smutteo.bsky.social/post/3l3qzrrkd622p) on Bsky
- **Cania** has written a [quick start guide](https://cania.neocities.org/blog/how-to-use-publii-to-make-a-blog-on-neocities-without-writing-html-and-minimal-css) for how to make a blog on Neocities or similar (try Nekoweb)!
- A bunch of other artists have moved to private Discord groups for the time being, some of them are also starting personal homepages.
- If you know someone else who's stepped into the community organizer role then let me know! Maybe I'll make a Cohost Legacy article like that LucasArts Legacy section on Wikipedia.

It's up to us to step up as moderators of our own communities. We should absolutely reach out to other members of the Cohost cohort (the **Cohorst**) for help, but ultimately I think the community is going to split and go several different ways.
