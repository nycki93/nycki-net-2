Does anyone have suggestions for comment boxes? I want something similar to [commentbox.io](https://commentbox.io/) but without anonymous comments (and I think $20/mo for that privilege alone is a little steep). I'm willing to self-host [schnack](https://schnack.cool/) but I was hoping for something I can recommend to other people without them having to self-host it.

Email me if you have any ideas!
