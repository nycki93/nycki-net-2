I wrote a [site template](https://github.com/nycki93/11ty-comic) for webcomics. It has the absolute bare minimum amount of html, css, and templating, because I figure if you're making a comic you probably want to do that stuff yourself! I might use it myself at some point, I used to write [an adventure comic](https://mspfa.com/?s=19)...
