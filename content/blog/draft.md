If I ask you what a can opener is, and you say

> A can opener is a service component that affords access to preserved fruits and vegetables.

This does not help me at all. I am looking for something along the lines of

> A can opener is a handheld metal tool that cuts the lids off of canned food, which you can buy at the grocery store. You use it by turning a knob, which puts pressure on two blades, which cut through the metal lid of the can.

Thank you.
