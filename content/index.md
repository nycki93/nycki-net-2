## creations

Stuff I've made!

### Braceless Javascript
2018\. a couple of short programs written in browser JavaScript, with the special restriction that I can't use any instructions that require curly braces, like 'if' or 'for'. instead, I replace these instructions with ternaries and lambdas, which makes this a functional programming exercise!

2008\. A ZZT game inspired by Portal. Available at the Museum of ZZT.

### ZZT Nanogames

2008\. A collection of ZZT games that use only one screen each. Also includes _Eight Legged Express_, which I believe was made in one weekend as a challenge.

### Collabyrinth

2008\. A collaborative labyrinth made in ZZT. I organized this collaboration on the z2 forums.
